# Handmade Quake

Experimenting with writing quake code while loosely following [handmade_quake series.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBKDuv-qJpTbCsXHsxcoSSsMarnfyNhHF)

# Building

Right now only linux specific code is written.
Only dependency is X11... i think.

Scons is used for building (Can't be bothered with makefiles anymore)
So for simple build just use:
```
scons
```
In base directory.
